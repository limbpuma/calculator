# calculator
In this project, I developed an interactive web calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it handles decimal inputs and provides an option to clear an entry.https://www.linkedin.com/in/limber-martinez-developer/
